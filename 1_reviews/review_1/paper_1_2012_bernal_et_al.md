Research questions and reason for the study:
---

This study tries to develop a model of polyp appearance that makes polyp detection automatic.
Regions of interest are segmented, followed by specific descriptions and its consequent classification.

- Reduction of miss rate.
- Add significant value to the colonoscopy procedure by means of CAD.

Basically, from analysis of colonoscopy images to auxiliary diagnostic.

Hypothesis or hypotheses tested:
---

Fact: intensity valleys appear to surround polyps as the light of the
colonoscope and the camera are in the same direction.

Hipothesis: valley and ridge information as cue to detect polyps.
    - Look for several cues to guide a model formation.

How the hypothesis was tested:
---

Three stages: region segmentation, region description and region
classification.


The findings:
---

First contribution: region segmentation stage, in which a image is decomposed
in a minimum number of informative region parts. One of these contains a polyp
in a complete way.

Second contribution: introduction of the Sector Accumulation--Depth of Valleys
Accumulation (SA-DOVA).

How the findings were interpreted:
---



---

How does the design of the study address the research questions?

How convicing are the results? Are any of the results surprising?

What does this study contribute toward answering the original question?

What aspects of the original question remain unanswered?

Tips:

1. Takes notes in your own words.

Summary:

1. State the research question and explain why it is interesting.
2. State the hypotheses tested.
3. Briefly describe the methods (design, participants, materials, procedure,
   what was manipulated [independent variables], what was measured [dependent
   variables], how data were analyzed.
4. Describe the results. Were they significant?
5. Explain the key implications of the results. Avoid overstating the
   importance of the findings.
6. The results, and the interpretation of the results, should relate directly
   to the hypothesis.

- Focus on content. Condense later as needed.
